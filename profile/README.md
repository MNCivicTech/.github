# MN Civic Tech 🌳

MN Civic Tech is a volunteer-driven organization dedicated to building technology for the public good in Minnesota. We bring together technologists, public servants, and community advocates to collaborate on projects that address local challenges and improve the lives of Minnesotans. MN Civic Tech initiatives focus on providing tools, services, or platforms that directly benefit the community, such as fostering civic engagement, improving public services, or addressing local issues.

Our mission goes beyond creating software—we build community. By fostering collaboration and innovation, we focus on building technology that directly benefits Minnesotans. Together, we’re cultivating a more connected, empathetic, and efficient Minnesota—where everyone has the opportunity to contribute to technology that improves the very place we live.
